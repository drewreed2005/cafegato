## About Us

Café Gato is a cat cafe, but it's also a sample online marketing campaign for *theoretical* cat cafes (or other businesses, for that matter). Rather than a website that simply has the necessary sign-ups, reservations, and information expected of a cat cafe site, we have created this to show the possible benefit of user interaction to a business's local success.

The reviews (Tanisha Patil) and events (Drew Reed) pages both leave room for user input, while the two games, "Not Bubsy 3D" (AJ Ruiz) and "Purr-dle" (Aliya Tang), both have a leaderboard to promote local competition for discounts.

Please help us realize this demonstration by trying out our programs!
